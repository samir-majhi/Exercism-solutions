# Exercism-solutions
Contains my solutions to the exercises on Exercism. Meant to show how I code. If you haven't heard fo exercism, check it out exercism.io. It's cool !

These are regular Ruby programs. You just need Ruby to run them. I've used Ubuntu. But they should work on Windows and Mac as well.
If you want to be part of the community and submit your own solutions then install the exercism CLI from exercism.io
